# FurationBookHubAssignment
Created with CodeSandbox
In this project let's build a **Book Hub** by applying the concepts we have learned till now. This project allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned till React Course and apply them in a concrete project.

You will demonstrate your skills by creating an app that will fetch data from an internal server using a **class component**, **displaying that data**, using **component lifecycle methods**, **routing concepts**, **authentication**, and **authorization**, and adding **responsiveness to the website**.

This is an individual assessment. All work must be your own.
